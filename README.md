Pinewood Derby Timer - Arduino Based.  

I am focused on building a fully featured and fully open source pinewood derby track made with easy to obtain and simple components.  

The purpose of this repository is to track changes and customizations to Pinewood Derby Timer by David Gadberry.  I have been using a customized fork of version 2.0 for my pinewood derby track since 2012.  

I am starting this repo by forking version 3.0 of PDT by Miscjunk http://www.miscjunk.org/mj/pg_pdt.html
with the focus on compatibility with DerbyNet https://github.com/jeffpiazza/derbynet http://jeffpiazza.github.io/derbynet and my home built track.
